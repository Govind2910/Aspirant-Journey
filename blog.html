                <h3>Confuse them with your silence Amaze them with your actions.</h3>
                <p>There were many a living testimony for the adage ‘no obstacle is big enough’ at the 142nd Passing-Out Parade of the Indian Military Academy (IMA) Dehradun on 6th December 2019. Several Gentlemen Cadets fought against both personal and financial odd to achieve their goal of joining the armed forces.

                    To Pradeep Kumar from Mainpuri, it was as if the entire village had come to witness his graduation from IMA. Son of a farmer, he is the first from the family to make it to the armed forces. He said, “We are all family and distant relatives. They were happy and wanted to come. So I invited all of them.”
                    
                    Similar is the story of Nishant Nauhwar, son of a lab technician from Agra. Nauhwar managed to crack both the CDS and NDA exams without expensive coaching or training.
                    
                    His father BS Nauhar said, “I am a lab technician in an Army school in Agra and our financial position is weak. It was my dream to see my son become an Army officer and he did it despite not getting proper facilities. He has worked very hard and is the first in our family to join the Army.”
                    
                    Rohit Singh, another cadet from a small village named Misri in Haryana, said, “Our family lives in a small village in Charkha Dadri district of Haryana. My grandfather was a havaldar while my father is a subedar in the Army. My father wanted me to become an Army officer and he persuaded me to appear for the NDA exam. I wasn’t able to qualify in the first attempt but managed it in the second. Now after four years of training, I will be joining the 16 Maratha Light Infantry Regiment.”
